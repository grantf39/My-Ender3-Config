# My-Ender3-Config

Configuration files are my own custom settings for Marlin 2.0x firmware for the Creality Ender 3 (regular version, not pro) with v4.2.2 motherboard.

Changes include:
  -BLtouch 3.0 modification to replace standard Z end stop
  -Set Probing offset
  -Adjust probing margins to center BLtouch bed leveling
  -Change print bed dimensions to account for bed shifting from ender 3 stepper motor dampener installation
  -Added Preheat PETG setting to Ender 3 Temperature menu
  -Changed a few other default settings
